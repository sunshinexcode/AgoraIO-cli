## General Rules

- Prefer `--json` for any command consumed by code, scripts, or agents.
- Prefer `agora init` for end-to-end setup.
- Use low-level commands when a workflow must be decomposed, resumed, or partially re-run.
- Use `agora --help --all` to inspect the full command tree (human-readable).
- Use `agora --help --all --json` for a machine-readable command tree with all flags — the primary capability discovery mechanism for agents.
- Use `agora introspect --json` when you need command labels, enums, and version metadata in a single stable artifact.
- Use `agora project doctor --json` for readiness checks before continuing with automated setup.
- Use `agora whoami --plain` for shell `if` chains that only need `authenticated` / `unauthenticated`.
- In JSON mode, both success and failure return the same top-level envelope shape.
- Use `--json --pretty` when a human needs to inspect JSON directly. Scripts should keep the default single-line JSON.
- Use `--quiet` to suppress the success envelope in **both** pretty and JSON modes; the exit code becomes the only result. Errors are still printed on stderr (and as a JSON envelope on stdout when `--json` is set without `--quiet`). NDJSON progress events are still emitted because they are observability, not results.
- Use `--debug` (equivalent to `AGORA_DEBUG=1`) to echo structured log records to stderr. The flag does not change exit codes, JSON envelope shape, or NDJSON progress events; it only mirrors the entries that would normally be written to the log file. Pair with `--json` for fully machine-parseable runs that also surface internal events to your CI logs. v0.2.0 dropped the legacy `--verbose` / `-v` alias and the `AGORA_VERBOSE` env var; persisted configs that contain a `verbose` key are auto-promoted to `debug` on first load.
- Use `--yes` (or `-y`) / `AGORA_NO_INPUT=1` to assume the default answer to confirmation prompts. Following industry convention for `-y` (apt-style), the flag never starts brand-new interactive flows: in JSON, CI, or non-TTY contexts the CLI still fails fast with the same `AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED` error you would have seen without `--yes`, instead of silently launching an OAuth browser flow.
- Interactive login prompts only appear in interactive pretty-mode TTY runs. Automation should authenticate up front with `agora login`; `--json`, `AGORA_OUTPUT=json`, detected CI environments, and non-TTY stdin all skip the prompt and fail with `AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED`.
- In non-interactive runs (`--yes`, JSON, CI, non-TTY), pass `--template` explicitly to `agora init`. The CLI now fails fast with `QUICKSTART_TEMPLATE_REQUIRED` instead of silently selecting a template.
- Output mode precedence is: explicit CLI flag (`--json` or `--output`) first, user-set `AGORA_OUTPUT` second, then user-customized config file value, then **CI auto-detect → JSON** (see below), then pretty.
- Set `AGORA_AGENT=<tool-name>` in automated environments to explicitly label agent traffic in the API `User-Agent`. When unset, the CLI may infer a coarse label such as `cursor`, `claude-code`, `cline`, `windsurf`, `codex`, or `aider` from known agent environment markers. Set `AGORA_AGENT_DISABLE_INFER=1` to disable inference.
- Use `agora mcp serve` to expose local Agora CLI tools to MCP-capable agents. The full surface is exposed: `agora.version`, `agora.introspect`, `agora.auth.{status,logout}`, `agora.config.{path,get}`, `agora.telemetry.status`, `agora.upgrade.check`, `agora.project.{list,show,use,create,doctor,env,env_write}`, `agora.project.feature.{list,status,enable}`, `agora.project.webhook.{events,list,show,create,update,delete}`, `agora.quickstart.{list,create,env_write}`, and `agora.init`. Authentication is intentionally **not** exposed via MCP because OAuth requires an interactive browser; run `agora login` once on the host first.
- Use `agora open --target docs` for the human GitHub Pages docs and `agora open --target docs-md` for the agent-facing raw Markdown index. In CI/non-TTY runs the command defaults to URL-only output unless `--browser` is set. The Markdown tree is published under predictable `/md/` URLs, for example `/md/commands.md`, `/md/automation.md`, and `/md/error-codes.md`.
- Docs publishing reads `docs/site.env` for `CLI_DOCS_*` and `CLI_INSTALL_*` URL defaults; staging Pages builds can override those environment variables at workflow time without changing docs content. The resolved values are published as `/docs.env` for transparency.
- The CLI maintains a short-lived on-disk completion cache for `agora project use <TAB>` under `<AGORA_HOME>/cache/projects.json`. The cache is only used for completions when a **local unexpired session exists** (`session.json` with a non-empty access token and a future `expiresAt`, when present), so Tab does not suggest stale project names after logout or local session expiry. The cache TTL is 5 minutes by default; override with `AGORA_PROJECT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=<seconds>` (set to `0` to disable). Cache files older than 24 h are pruned at every CLI startup. Set `AGORA_DISABLE_CACHE=1` to drop the cache on the next startup. The cache is invalidated automatically by `agora logout` and `agora project create` (the latter clears the file; it does not embed the new project until the next successful list fetch). To **force-refresh** the cached completion page, run `agora project list --refresh-cache` while authenticated; that command fetches the unfiltered first page used by completion and rewrites `projects.json` when it succeeds.

### CI auto-detect

When the CLI detects it is running inside a CI environment, it automatically:

- Switches the default output mode to `--output json` (so build logs stay machine-parseable).
- Suppresses the first-run "Config initialized" banner on stderr.
- Skips interactive prompts (login confirmation, project reuse confirmation, template picker).

CI is detected when **any** of the following environment variables is present (and `CI` is not literally `false`/`0`/empty):

| Variable          | Vendor             |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| `CI`              | de-facto universal |
| `GITHUB_ACTIONS`  | GitHub Actions     |
| `GITLAB_CI`       | GitLab CI          |
| `BUILDKITE`       | Buildkite          |
| `CIRCLECI`        | CircleCI           |
| `JENKINS_URL`     | Jenkins            |
| `TF_BUILD`        | Azure Pipelines    |

You can always override:

- `--output pretty` — force pretty output even in CI.
- `AGORA_OUTPUT=pretty` — same, via env (user-set values always win over auto-detect).
- `AGORA_DISABLE_CI_DETECT=1` — disable CI detection entirely (useful when iterating on a CI script locally).

Primary command groups:
- `init`
- `quickstart`
- `project`
- `auth`
- `config`

## Project Resolution Precedence

Commands that require a project resolve context in this order:
1. explicit `--project` or positional project argument
2. repo-local `.agora/project.json` from the target repo path
3. global CLI context selected by `agora project use`

Agent guidance:
- prefer explicit `--project` for deterministic cross-repo operations
- rely on repo-local binding when operating repeatedly inside one bound quickstart
- keep `metadataPath` from command results if you need to validate or audit project bindings

## Config Isolation

The CLI creates or migrates its config directory on startup. In CI, tests, and multi-agent runs, isolate config and session state with `AGORA_HOME` so concurrent jobs do not mutate a shared developer profile:

```bash
export AGORA_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
agora auth status --json
agora init my-nextjs-demo --template nextjs --project my-project --json
```

`AGORA_HOME` points directly at the Agora CLI config directory. `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is also supported, but `AGORA_HOME` is the most explicit option for short-lived automation.

## JSON Envelope

Commands that support structured output return a JSON envelope in this shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "init",
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "outputMode": "json",
    "exitCode": 0
  }
}
```

Stable top-level fields:
- `ok`
  `true` for success and `false` for failure.
- `command`
  Stable command label used by the CLI for the result payload.
- `data`
  Command-specific result payload. This is usually `null` on failure. `project doctor --json` keeps its diagnostic payload on readiness failures so agents can inspect blocking issues while still branching on `ok: false`.
- `error`
  Present on failure with a stable error object.
  Known structured failures may include `error.code`, `error.httpStatus`, and `error.requestId` in addition to `error.message`.
- `meta.outputMode`
  Currently `json` when `--json` is used.
- `meta.exitCode`
  Process exit code for this result. Success envelopes use `0`; error envelopes use the nonzero process exit code.

Agent guidance:
- branch on `command` and `data`
- branch on `ok` first for success vs failure
- treat pretty output as human-only
- do not parse stderr when `--json` is in use

A **JSON Schema** for this envelope is published at
[`docs/schema/envelope.v1.json`](schema/envelope.v1.json) (also available
at the live URL `https://agoraio.github.io/cli/schema/envelope.v1.json`).
Wrappers that want compile-time type safety can generate types from the
schema with `quicktype`, `datamodel-code-generator`, or any
JSON-Schema-aware tool.

## Envelope Versioning

The current contract is `envelope.v1.json`. Minor CLI releases may add fields to envelopes, progress events, command result `data`, and introspection records. Agents must ignore unknown fields.

Breaking envelope changes require a new schema file such as `envelope.v2.json`, a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and a migration note in this document. Removing fields, changing field types, or changing the meaning of existing enum values is treated as breaking.

### One documented exception: `agora project env`

`agora project env` is the only command whose **default** (non-JSON)
output is raw stdout — without the unified envelope — so it can be used
with shell substitution:

```bash
source <(agora project env --shell)
eval "$(agora project env --format shell)"
```

To explicitly request a specific format, pass `--format`:

| Flag                  | Output                                    |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--format dotenv`     | `KEY=value` lines (default; `>> .env`)    |
| `--format shell`      | shell `export KEY=value` statements       |
| `--format envelope`   | unified JSON envelope (alias of `--json`) |
| `--format json`       | same as `--format envelope`               |
| `--shell`             | back-compat alias of `--format shell`     |
| `--json`              | unified JSON envelope                     |

For automation, prefer `--json` (or `--format envelope`) so the result
has the same shape as every other command. `agora project env write`
already emits the unified envelope under all output modes — only the
read path has the raw-stdout exception above.

In interactive pretty TTY sessions, running `agora project env` without an explicit `--format`, `--shell`, or `--json` prints a stderr hint pointing agents to `--json` / `--format envelope`. The hint is not emitted in JSON mode or non-TTY automation.

## Progress Events (NDJSON Stream)

Long-running commands emit one or more **progress events** to stdout ahead of the final envelope when `--json` is set. The wire format is **NDJSON** (newline-delimited JSON): one complete JSON object per line, terminated by `\n`.

Agents must therefore parse stdout line-by-line, not as a single JSON document. The terminal envelope is always the **last** line and is the only object with the top-level `ok` field.

### Event shape

```json
{"event":"progress","command":"init","stage":"clone:start","message":"Cloning quickstart repository","timestamp":"2026-04-29T22:30:00.123Z","repoUrl":"https://github.com/AgoraIO/...","targetPath":"/abs/path","ref":""}
```

Stable top-level fields on every progress event:

- `event` — always the literal string `"progress"`. Use this to distinguish progress events from the terminal envelope (which has `"ok"` instead).
- `command` — the same stable command label used by the terminal envelope.
- `stage` — a stable enum-like string identifying the milestone. See the table below.
- `message` — short human-readable description suitable for a log line.
- `timestamp` — RFC3339Nano UTC timestamp.

Additional stage-specific fields may appear (for example `repoUrl`, `projectId`, `loginUrl`). These are documented per-stage but agents should treat unknown extra fields as opaque metadata.

### Stable stage taxonomy

| Stage | Emitted by | When | Stage-specific fields |
|-------|------------|------|------------------------|
| `clone:override` | `quickstart create`, `init` | Before `clone:start` when an `AGORA_QUICKSTART_<TEMPLATE>_REPO_URL` override is in use | `repoUrl`, `envVar` |
| `clone:start` | `quickstart create`, `init` | Before the `git clone` shell-out | `repoUrl`, `targetPath`, `ref` |
| `clone:complete` | `quickstart create`, `init` | After `git clone` succeeds | `targetPath` |
| `clone:strip-git` | `quickstart create`, `init` | After upstream `.git` metadata is removed from the scaffold | `targetPath` |
| `project:create` | `init` | Before creating a new Agora project | `projectName`, `features` |
| `project:created` | `init` | After the project is ready | `projectId`, `projectName` |
| `project:reuse` | `init` | When binding to an existing project | `projectId`, `projectName` |
| `oauth:waiting` | `login`, `auth login` | After the localhost callback server is listening and the URL is printed | `loginUrl`, `redirectUri`, `timeoutMs` |
| `oauth:received` | `login`, `auth login` | When the browser callback delivers an authorization code | (none) |
| `oauth:complete` | `login`, `auth login` | After the access token is stored locally | (none) |

### Sample stream (init)

```text
{"event":"progress","command":"init","stage":"project:reuse","message":"Reusing existing Agora project","timestamp":"...","projectId":"prj_abc","projectName":"Default Project"}
{"event":"progress","command":"init","stage":"clone:start","message":"Cloning quickstart repository","timestamp":"...","repoUrl":"...","targetPath":"...","ref":""}
{"event":"progress","command":"init","stage":"clone:complete","message":"Quickstart repository cloned","timestamp":"...","targetPath":"..."}
{"event":"progress","command":"init","stage":"clone:strip-git","message":"Removed quickstart repository history","timestamp":"...","targetPath":"..."}
{"ok":true,"command":"init","data":{},"meta":{"exitCode":0,"outputMode":"json"}}
```

### Parsing rules for agents

1. Read stdout line by line until EOF.
2. JSON-decode each line independently.
3. Discard or log lines that do not parse as JSON (defensive).
4. The line where `event === "progress"` is a progress event; `stage` and `message` are the most useful fields.
5. The first (and only) line where `ok` is set is the terminal envelope.
6. Process exit code is also reported in `meta.exitCode` of the terminal envelope; treat the OS exit code as the source of truth.

Stages are stable identifiers; new stages may be added over time. Agents should treat unknown stages as benign progress information rather than failing on them.

## MCP Progress Notifications

When long-running tools are invoked through MCP with `_meta.progressToken`, `agora mcp serve` forwards stage updates as JSON-RPC `notifications/progress` frames before the final `tools/call` response. This keeps stdio framing valid while allowing host agents to display progress.

Example `tools/call` params:

```json
{
  "name": "agora.quickstart.create",
  "arguments": {
    "template": "nextjs",
    "dir": "my-demo"
  },
  "_meta": {
    "progressToken": "demo-1"
  }
}
```

Example progress notification:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/progress","params":{"progressToken":"demo-1","progress":1,"stage":"clone:start","message":"Cloning quickstart repository","timestamp":"..."}}
```

The final MCP tool result is unchanged: the CLI result payload is JSON-stringified into `content[0].text`.

Implications for agent authors:

- Use `_meta.progressToken` when calling `agora.init`, `agora.quickstart.create`, or `agora.project.create` and your host can display progress notifications.
- Without a progress token, MCP calls remain a single final response.
- Plan for higher tail latency on MCP `tools/call` for the affected tools; the user-visible "nothing is happening" gap may be tens of seconds for git clones or project creation. Consider surfacing your own "running tool: agora.init…" UI in the host agent.
- The terminal payload shape returned in `content[0].text` is identical to the CLI's terminal `data` envelope, so existing JSON-shape handlers continue to work unchanged.
- Shell commands (`agora ... --json`) still use NDJSON progress events followed by the terminal envelope.

Failure example:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "project env write",
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "message": "path/to/.env.custom already exists. Use --append to append it or --overwrite to replace it.",
    "logFilePath": "/path/to/agora-cli.log"
  },
  "meta": {
    "outputMode": "json",
    "exitCode": 1
  }
}
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Commands |
|------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Success | all commands |
| 1 | General error or blocking issue | most commands; `project doctor` when blocking issues found |
| 2 | Non-blocking warning | `project doctor` when only warnings found |
| 3 | Auth or session error | `project doctor` when not authenticated; `auth status` / `whoami` when unauthenticated |

In JSON mode the `meta.exitCode` field carries the same value as the process exit code.

Known `error.code` values are cataloged in [error-codes.md](error-codes.md).

## Stable Result Shapes

The following commands are part of the documented JSON contract.

### `introspect`

Example:

```bash
./agora introspect --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `commands`
  Array of enumerable command metadata.
- `globalFlags`
  Root flags inherited by commands.
- `pseudoCommands`
  Stable command labels emitted by root flags such as `agora --upgrade-check`.
- `enums`
  Known enum values for agent validation.
- `version`
  Build metadata.

Each `commands[]` item includes `path`, `command`, `short`, `flags`, `headlessSafe`, and `interactivity`. Agents should use `headlessSafe=false` to avoid flows that require direct user interaction, and use `interactivity` for a human-readable reason such as `interactive-browser`, `stdio-server`, or `browser-in-interactive-pretty-mode`.

### `init`

Example:

```bash
./agora init my-nextjs-demo --template nextjs --json
./agora init my-nextjs-demo --template nextjs --new-project --json
```

By default `init` reuses an existing project — preferring one named exactly `"Default Project"`. If no default exists, interactive sessions show existing projects with a create-new option and default to the most recently created project; JSON, CI, and non-TTY runs select the most recent project automatically. Pass `--new-project` to force creation. Use `--project <name|id>` to bind to a specific project.
For deterministic automation, always pass `--project <name|id>` or `--new-project`.

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `init`.
- `template`
  Template ID such as `nextjs`, `python`, or `go`.
- `projectAction`
  `created` or `existing`.
- `reusedExistingProject`
  Boolean mirror for agents that branch on init reuse.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `projectSelectionReason`
  One of `explicit_project`, `new_project`, `no_existing_projects`, `default_name`, `interactive_new_project`, `interactive_selection`, or `most_recent`.
- `region`
- `path`
  Absolute path to the cloned quickstart.
- `envPath`
  Path of the env file relative to the cloned quickstart root.
- `metadataPath`
  Repo-local project binding file path, currently `.agora/project.json`.
- `enabledFeatures`
  Array of features enabled during this run. Defaults to `rtc`, `rtm`, and `convoai` for newly created projects unless overridden with `--feature`. Empty for existing projects since the CLI did not create them in this run.
- `nextSteps`
  Ordered list of suggested follow-up commands for the selected template.
- `status`
  Currently `ready`.

Optional fields:
- `rtmDataCenter`
  RTM data center configured on the new project when RTM was enabled. Defaults to `NA` when `--rtm-data-center` is omitted.

Display-oriented fields:
- `title`

Safe branch fields:
- `template`
- `projectAction`
- `projectId`
- `path`
- `envPath`
- `status`

### `project create`

Automation notes:
- `--dry-run` returns the planned envelope (`status: "planned"`, `dryRun: true`) without creating remote resources.
- `--idempotency-key <key>` is forwarded to the API body for retry-safe project creation where supported.

Example:

```bash
./agora project create my-agent-demo --json
./agora project create my-agent-demo --rtm-data-center EU --json
./agora project create my-agent-demo --feature rtc --feature convoai --json
```

Required `data` fields (success):
- `action`
  Always `create`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `appId`
- `region`
- `enabledFeatures`
  Array of features that were enabled on the new project. Defaults to `["rtc", "rtm", "convoai"]` when no `--feature` flags are passed. Explicit `convoai` requests also include `rtm`.

Optional fields:
- `rtmDataCenter`
  RTM data center configured when RTM was enabled. Defaults to `NA` when `--rtm-data-center` is omitted.

Required `data` fields (`--dry-run`):
- `action`
  Always `create`.
- `dryRun`
  Always `true`.
- `status`
  Always `planned`.
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `enabledFeatures`
- `template`
  Project preset that would be applied (empty when not requested).
- `idempotencyKey`
  Echoes the caller-provided `--idempotency-key` value (empty when not provided).

Optional fields (`--dry-run`):
- `rtmDataCenter`
  Uppercased data center value (`CN`, `NA`, `EU`, or `AP`) when RTM is enabled. Defaults to `NA` when omitted.

Safe branch fields:
- `projectId` (success only)
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `enabledFeatures`
- `status` (`--dry-run` only)
- `dryRun` (`--dry-run` only)

### `project use`

Example:

```bash
./agora project use my-agent-demo --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `use`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `status`
  Currently `selected`.

Safe branch fields:
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `status`

### `project show`

Example:

```bash
./agora project show --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `show`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `appId`
- `region`
- `tokenEnabled`

Optional fields:
- `appCertificate`
  The app certificate (signing key). Present when the project has one configured. Sensitive — redacted in pretty output; available in JSON mode.

Display-oriented fields:
- `appCertificate`

Safe branch fields:
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `appId`
- `region`
- `tokenEnabled`

### `project env write`

Example:

```bash
./agora project env write apps/web/.env.local --json
```

Optional `data` fields:
- `credentialLayout`
  Either `standard` (AGORA_* keys) or `nextjs` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`) when the workspace is detected or overridden as Next.js.

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `env-write`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `path`
  Absolute path to the written dotenv file.
- `projectType`
  Detected workspace type used for future repo metadata (`nextjs`, `go`, `python`, `node`, or `standard`).
- `status`
  One of `created`, `updated`, `appended`, or `overwritten`.
- `keysWritten`
  Ordered list of credential keys that were written. By default `project env write` uses `AGORA_APP_ID` and `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`. Next.js workspaces (detected via `package.json` / `next.config.*` / `env.local.example` / repo `.agora` `projectType` / `template: nextjs`, or forced with `--template nextjs`) use `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` instead. Non-secret project metadata stays in `.agora/project.json`.

Optional `data` fields (present when the CLI updates or creates repo metadata):
- `metadataUpdated`
  `true` when `.agora/project.json` was created or updated for the selected project (including `projectType` and `envPath` when missing).
- `metadataPath`
  Relative path `.agora/project.json` from the repo root when `metadataUpdated` is true.

Pass `--template standard` to force AGORA_* keys when auto-detection would pick Next.js.

Write behavior:
- existing `.env` and `.env.local` files are preserved; missing credential keys are appended and existing credential keys are updated
- existing legacy Agora-managed blocks are replaced with plain credential assignments
- duplicate credential assignments are commented out after the first updated key
- explicit non-standard env files still require `--append` or `--overwrite` when they do not already contain managed credentials

Safe branch fields:
- `path`
- `status`
- `keysWritten`
- `credentialLayout`
- `projectType`
- `metadataUpdated` (when repo binding was updated)
- `metadataPath` (when `metadataUpdated` is true)

### `project env`

Example:

```bash
./agora project env --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `env`.
- `format`
  Currently `json`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `values`
  Object containing the rendered env key/value pairs.

Safe branch fields:
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `region`
- `values`

### `quickstart list`

Example:

```bash
./agora quickstart list --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `list`.
- `items`
  Array of template objects.

Each item currently includes:

- `docsUrl`
- `available`
- `envDocs`
- `supportsInit`

- `items[].supportsInit`

Display-oriented fields:
- `title`
- `description`
- `docsUrl`
- `envDocs`

### `quickstart create`

Automation notes:
- `--ref <branch|tag|ref>` pins the cloned quickstart source for workshops and reproducible demos.

Example:

```bash
./agora quickstart create my-python-demo --template python --project my-project --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `create`.
- `template`
- `title`
- `runtime`
- `cloneUrl`
- `docsUrl`
- `path`
  Absolute path to the cloned quickstart.
- `envStatus`
  `template-only` or `configured`.
- `envPath`
  Empty when no project was bound during creation.
- `metadataPath`
  `.agora/project.json` when the quickstart was bound to a project during creation.
- `status`
  Currently `cloned`.
- `written`

Optional fields:
- `projectId`
- `projectName`

Safe branch fields:
- `template`
- `path`
- `envStatus`
- `envPath`
- `status`
- `projectId`

### `quickstart env write`

Example:

```bash
./agora quickstart env write /abs/path/to/my-python-demo --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `env-write`.
- `template`
- `title`
- `path`
  Absolute path to the quickstart root.
- `envPath`
  Env file path relative to the quickstart root.
- `metadataPath`
  Repo-local project binding file path, currently `.agora/project.json`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `status`
  Currently `created`, `updated`, or `appended`.

Env write behavior:
- quickstart env files contain only the App ID and App Certificate variable names required by the template
- Next.js uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`
- Python and Go use `APP_ID` and `APP_CERTIFICATE`
- project metadata such as project ID, project name, region, template, projectType, and env path is stored in `.agora/project.json`
- existing quickstart env files are preserved; missing credential keys are appended and existing credential keys are updated
- stale Agora credential aliases for another runtime are commented out to avoid ambiguous dotenv resolution; for example, a Next.js quickstart prefers `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and comments out old `AGORA_APP_ID` / `APP_ID` entries when replacing them

Safe branch fields:
- `template`
- `path`
- `envPath`
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `status`

### `project doctor`

Example:

```bash
./agora project doctor --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `doctor`.
- `healthy`
- `mode`
  `default` or `deep`.
- `status`
  One of `healthy`, `warning`, `not_ready`, or `auth_error`.
- `summary`
- `checks`
  Array of category objects.
- `blockingIssues`
  Array of blocking issue objects.
- `warnings`
  Array of warning issue objects.

Optional fields:
- `project`
  Nil during auth or project-selection failure paths.
- `workspace`
  Present in deep mode with repo-local binding and env consistency details.

Safe branch fields:
- `healthy`
- `mode`
- `status`
- `summary`
- `blockingIssues`
- `warnings`

Recommended agent behavior:
- branch first on `status`
- use `healthy` as a fast readiness boolean
- inspect `blockingIssues[].suggestedCommand` for recovery suggestions
- for repo-bound validation, run `project doctor --deep --json`

### `auth status`

Examples:

```bash
./agora auth status --json
./agora whoami --json
```

When authenticated, this command returns a success envelope with these required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `status`.
- `authenticated`
- `status`
  `authenticated`.
- `region`
- `expiresAt`
- `scope`

Safe branch fields:
- `authenticated`
- `region`
- `status`
- `expiresAt`

When unauthenticated, this command returns exit code `3` and an error envelope:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "auth status",
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "message": "No local Agora session found. Run `agora login` first.",
    "code": "AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED",
    "logFilePath": "/path/to/agora-cli.log"
  },
  "meta": {
    "outputMode": "json",
    "exitCode": 3
  }
}
```

Agent guidance:
- branch on `ok` before reading `data`
- handle `error.code == "AUTH_UNAUTHENTICATED"` as the unauthenticated state
- run `agora login` before continuing with commands that require a session

### `auth login`

Example:

```bash
./agora login --json
./agora auth login --json
```

`login --json` is an NDJSON stream, not a single JSON blob: it emits `oauth:waiting`, `oauth:received`, and `oauth:complete` progress events before the final envelope. Parse stdout line-by-line and use the last object with top-level `ok` as the command result.

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `login`.
- `status`
  Currently `authenticated`.
- `region`
- `scope`
- `expiresAt`

Safe branch fields:
- `region`
- `status`
- `expiresAt`

### `auth logout`

Example:

```bash
./agora logout --json
./agora auth logout --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `logout`.
- `status`
  Currently `logged-out`.
- `clearedSession`
  `true` if a session file was removed; `false` if no session existed.

Safe branch fields:
- `status`
- `clearedSession`

### `project list`

Example:

```bash
./agora project list --json
./agora project list --keyword demo --page 2 --json
./agora project list --refresh-cache --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `items`
  Array of project summary objects.
- `page`
  Current page number (1-based).
- `pageSize`
  Number of items per page.
- `total`
  Total number of matching projects across all pages.
- `cacheRefreshed`
  Boolean. `true` only when `--refresh-cache` successfully refreshed the unfiltered first-page project completion cache.

Each item includes: `projectId`, `name`, `appId`, `projectType`, `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

Safe branch fields:
- `items[].projectId`
- `items[].name`
- `total`
- `page`
- `pageSize`

### `project feature list`

Example:

```bash
./agora project feature list --json
./agora project feature list my-project --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `feature-list`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `items`
  Array of feature status objects.

Each item includes: `feature` (one of `rtc`, `rtm`, `convoai`), `status` (one of `enabled`, `disabled`, `included`, `provisioning`), `message`.

Safe branch fields:
- `projectId`
- `items[].feature`
- `items[].status`

### `project feature status`

Example:

```bash
./agora project feature status convoai --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `feature-status`.
- `feature`
- `status`
  One of `enabled`, `disabled`, `included`, `provisioning`.
- `message`
- `projectId`
- `projectName`

Safe branch fields:
- `feature`
- `status`
- `projectId`

### `project feature enable`

Example:

```bash
./agora project feature enable convoai --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `feature-enable`.
- `feature`
- `status`
  One of `enabled`, `included`.
- `message`
- `projectId`
- `projectName`

Safe branch fields:
- `feature`
- `status`
- `projectId`

### `project webhook`

Examples:

```bash
./agora project webhook events --feature rtc --json
./agora project webhook create --project my-project --feature rtc --url https://example.com/webhook --events channel-created,user-joined --json
./agora project webhook show 42 --project my-project --feature rtc --with-secret --json
./agora project webhook update 42 --project my-project --feature rtc --url https://example.com/webhook2 --json
./agora project webhook delete 42 --project my-project --feature rtc --yes --json
```

Webhook commands are feature-scoped. Pass `--feature rtc`, `--feature rtm`, or `--feature convoai` and prefer explicit `--project <id|name>` for automation.

`project webhook events` required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `webhook-events`.
- `feature`
- `items`
  Array of event objects.

Each event item includes:
- `id`
- `key`
  Stable CLI event key derived from the English display name, for example `channel-created`.
- `displayName`
- `eventType`
- `payload` when provided by the API.

`project webhook list` required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `webhook-list`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `feature`
- `events`
  The available event catalog for the selected feature.
- `items`
  Array of webhook config objects.

Each list item includes:
- `configId`
- `url`
- `urlRegion`
  Delivery region for webhook callbacks: `cn`, `sea`, `na`, or `eu`.
- `enabled`
  Canonical webhook state field. Webhook JSON does not emit a string `status`.
- `eventIds`
- `events`
  Event details that match `eventIds` when available.
- `retry`
  Retry behavior when returned by the API. This field is read-only in the CLI.
- `useIpWhitelist`
- `secret`
  Present when the backend returns a secret, redacted as `********`. `list` never emits a raw secret.

`project webhook show`, `project webhook create`, and `project webhook update` required `data` fields:
- `action`
  One of `webhook-show`, `webhook-create`, or `webhook-update`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `feature`
- `configId`
- `url`
- `urlRegion`
  Delivery region for webhook callbacks: `cn`, `sea`, `na`, or `eu`.
- `enabled`
  Canonical webhook state field. Webhook JSON does not emit a string `status`.
- `eventIds`
- `events`
  Event details that match `eventIds` when available.
- `useIpWhitelist`
- `config`
  Nested webhook config object with the same config fields.

Optional top-level `data` fields for `show`, `create`, and `update` (also present in the nested `config` object when set):
- `secret`
  Webhook signing secret. `create` returns the generated or caller-provided secret at `data.secret` and `data.config.secret` so automation can store it. `show` returns the raw secret only with `--with-secret`; otherwise it redacts `data.secret` and `data.config.secret` as `********`. `update` does not rotate secrets; when the backend returns a secret, `update` emits the redacted value. `list` has no top-level `secret`; item secrets are redacted as `items[].secret == "********"`.
- `retry`
  Retry behavior when returned by the API. This field is read-only in the CLI and appears at `data.retry` and `data.config.retry`; `list` exposes it per item as `items[].retry`.

`project webhook create` requires `--events <event-id-or-key>[,<event-id-or-key>...]`. `project webhook update` preserves existing values for omitted mutable fields. Use `--url`, `--events`, `--delivery-region`, `--enabled`, or `--disabled` to replace only those fields. `update` does not rotate or emit the raw secret.

`project webhook delete` required `data` fields:
- `action`
  Always `webhook-delete`.
- `projectId`
- `projectName`
- `feature`
- `configId`
- `deleted`
  `true` after the remote config is deleted.

Delete is destructive and requires confirmation. Pass `--yes` (or `-y`) in CLI automation; the MCP delete tool requires `confirm: true`.

Safe branch fields by command shape:
- Event discovery: `feature`, `items[].id`, `items[].key`
- List: `projectId`, `feature`, `items[].configId`, `items[].enabled`, `items[].eventIds`, `items[].urlRegion`
- Show/create/update: `projectId`, `feature`, `configId`, `enabled`, `eventIds`, `urlRegion`
- Delete: `projectId`, `feature`, `configId`, `deleted`

### `config path`

Example:

```bash
./agora config path --json
```

Required `data` fields:
- `path`
  Absolute path to the config file on disk.

Safe branch fields:
- `path`

### `config get`

Example:

```bash
./agora config get --json
```

Returns the current resolved config object. Safe branch fields:
- `output`
- `logLevel`
- `browserAutoOpen`
- `telemetryEnabled`
- `debug` (renamed from legacy `verbose` in v0.2.0; legacy key is migrated on first load)

Endpoint and OAuth integration values are derived from the active login
region and may be temporarily overridden with environment variables such as
`AGORA_API_BASE_URL`, `AGORA_OAUTH_BASE_URL`, `AGORA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and
`AGORA_OAUTH_SCOPE`; they are not persisted in `config.json`.

Migration note: configs written by older CLI versions may contain
`apiBaseUrl`, `oauthBaseUrl`, `oauthClientId`, or `oauthScope`. Schema version
4 drops those keys on first load. If automation previously depended on those
persisted values, set the corresponding `AGORA_*` environment variable in the
job environment instead.

### `config update`

Example:

```bash
./agora config update --output json --json
./agora config update --telemetry-enabled=false --json
```

Boolean config flags use Cobra's explicit false syntax. To disable a boolean, pass `--flag=false` (for example `--telemetry-enabled=false`, `--browser-auto-open=false`, or `--debug=false`); omitting the flag leaves the persisted value unchanged.

Returns the updated config object with the same shape as `config get`. Safe branch fields are the same as `config get`.

### `upgrade`

Example:

```bash
./agora upgrade --json
./agora upgrade --check --json
./agora --upgrade-check --json
```

CI/agent guidance: prefer `--check` (or `--upgrade-check`) so automation does not mutate the running binary.

Required `data` fields:
- `action`
  `upgrade` for the subcommand and `upgrade-check` for the root `--upgrade-check` pseudo-command.
- `installMethod`
  One of `installer`, `npm`, `homebrew`, `scoop`, `chocolatey`, `winget`, or `unknown`.
- `installSource`
  `install.sh` / `install.ps1` when read from a valid direct-installer receipt, `path` when inferred from the resolved executable path, or `fallback` when no durable source was available.
- `installedPath`
  Resolved executable path used for receipt validation and path inference.
- `upgradeCommand`
  The user-facing command for the owning install channel.
- `command`
  Backwards-compatible alias for `upgradeCommand`.
- `status`
  One of `manual`, `dry-run`, `up-to-date`, or `upgraded`.

Optional fields:
- `receiptPath`
  Path to the validated `agora.install.json` receipt when present.
- `currentVersion`
  Version of the running binary for `agora upgrade`.
- `latestVersion`
  Latest resolved release version when the command resolves GitHub release metadata.
- `version`
  Structured version payload for `agora --upgrade-check`.
- `receiptWarning`
  Nonfatal warning when a direct-installer self-update succeeded but the CLI could not refresh `agora.install.json`.
- `ciBlocked`
  Present and `true` when installer-managed self-update is skipped because CI auto-detect is active and `AGORA_ALLOW_UPGRADE_IN_CI` is not set.
- `suggestedCommand`
  Suggested non-mutating check command when `ciBlocked` is true.

Upgrade behavior:
- direct-installer installs (`installMethod: "installer"`) self-update in place after downloading the GitHub release archive and verifying it against `checksums.txt`
- archive prefix is version-aware: `agora-cli-go_*` for target releases v0.1.7–v0.2.0, `agora-cli_*` for v0.2.1+
- in CI, installer-managed self-update is skipped by default (`status: "manual"` + `ciBlocked: true`); set `AGORA_ALLOW_UPGRADE_IN_CI=1` to opt in
- package-manager installs return `status: "manual"` with the owning package-manager command; agents should run that command only after user approval
- `unknown` means the CLI could not verify the install channel, usually because the binary is a development/test build

Safe branch fields:
- `installMethod`
- `installSource`
- `upgradeCommand`
- `status`

## Human vs Machine Output

- Pretty output is optimized for humans.
- JSON output is the supported machine-readable contract.
- For reliable automation, do not parse help text or pretty output.
- Use `--output pretty` to force human output when `AGORA_OUTPUT=json` is set in the environment.

Recommended pattern:

```bash
./agora project doctor --json
./agora init my-go-demo --template go --json
./agora quickstart env write my-go-demo --json
```
